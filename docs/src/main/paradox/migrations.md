# Migration

* Before migrating to Apache Pekko Persistence Cassandra, ensure that you have [migrated](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-cassandra/1.0.6/migrations.html) to akka-persistence-cassandra 1.0.6
* The core [Pekko migration guide](https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko/current/project/migration-guides.html) is also worth reading.
* Note that this project uses the `pekko` [keyspace](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/data_modeling/data_modeling_schema.html) instead of `akka`.
